# HPC scripts
Scipts in this folder were used to generate data on the Cirrus HPC. Three types of scripts are present:
* scripts with .pbs file extension were submitted using the PBS batch submission
* scripts with .sh and .py were used on the local node on the HPC to perform small tasks like benchmarking and parsing mapping files
